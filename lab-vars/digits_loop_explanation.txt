To make the digits program work for any number of digits, you have to set a while loop that starts at the 1 digit, and goes 'upwards' towards the Most Significant Digit. This is done by using the modulus of the number with the digit value one posistion higher. For example, to find the 1's digit, you must calculate the number % 10. The 10's digit is found by subtracting the previous digit found, then getting the modulus with 100.
